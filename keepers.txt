This guide makes the assumption that you have a baseline understanding of Path of Exile and does not include detailed descriptions of older mechanics. 

Mechanics related to the current league or new mechanics in general will naturally be covered somewhat in depth. 

# The League Hasn't Started Yet
Also, the challenges haven't been revealed.

It makes it a bit difficult to write anything, you know?

# Unlocks
This league is another full armour set with 36 completed challenges required to unlock all four pieces. The unlock order is presumed based on the previous league.
- At 12 challenge completion you can unlock the Keeper of the Flame Boots.
- At 20 challenge completion you can unlock the Keeper of the Flame Gloves.
- At 28 challenge completion you can unlock the Keeper of the Flame Body Armour.
- At 36 challenge completion you can unlock the Keeper of the Flame Helmet.
