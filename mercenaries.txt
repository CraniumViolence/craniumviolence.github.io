# Mercenaries of Trarthus Challenges
Please get in touch through [Github](https://github.com/CraniumViolence/craniumviolence.github.io) if any information here is incorrect, absent or you simply have better strategies or information! 

You can also get in touch on [Reddit under CraniumCarnage](https://www.reddit.com/user/CraniumCarnage/) or by simply replying in the [obvious post about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1lhxtoo/mercenaries_full_challenge_guide/).

This guide makes the assumption that you have a baseline understanding of Path of Exile and does not include complex instructions for a lot of aspects such as explaining what each mechanic is in depth (with the obvious exception of current league or new mechanics getting more attention). 

Nothing on this page is SSF oriented but as previously, if people want things flagged as bad for SSF for whatever reason just shout at me on the link above.

This is genuinely maybe the easiest 40 they've ever had. It's made up for by the fact if you are in Europe, Russia, Asia or use the Washington server the game is borderline unplayable and will regular destroy instances, what a treat!

</div>

# 3 Peddler's Produce I
<div id="ch-3" markdown="3">
## Very Easy
[.ggg]Complete vendor recipes to receive each of the following items. A vendor recipe is when you trade a specific combination of items to a vendor, not when you buy items from their purchase screen.
- [.ggg]Life or Mana Flask
	- [.com]`Three of a single type of Life or Mana Flask` will upgrade into the next tier for this
- [.ggg]Boots with Movement Speed
	- [.com]Vendor a pair of `Normal Rarity Boots + Quicksilver Flask + Orb of Augmentation`
- [.ggg]Any Ring or Amulet
	- [.com]Vendor an Iron Ring and any colour of gem
- [.ggg]Orb of Chance
	- [.com]Vendor two items with **identical names**
		- [.com]The trade site allows you to search by item name, even if it's not exposed in an obvious manner
			- [.com]Simply type something like `Brood Road` into the search to get identically named items to buy
			- [.com]Searching by simply an item class with rarity set to rare will get you easy item names to copy
		- [.com]If you simply get a rare item out of a strongbox which creates mirrored items you will have a second copy with an identical name
	- [.com]Vendor a full set of rare items with at least one item below item level 60
		- [.com]1x `Helmet`
		- [.com]1x `Body Armour`
		- [.com]1x `Gloves`
		- [.com]1x `Boots`
		- [.com]1x `Two Handed Weapon` or 2x `One Handed Weapon`

		- [.com]2x `Rings`
	- [.com]Vendor a set of the exact same item in Normal, Magic, Rare and Unique rarities
		
Bog standard vendor recipes, the `Orb of Chance` recipe is slightly exotic for a change. 

You can still just do the chaos recipe version though which is a bit more boring than the pair and straight flush options.

</div>

# 9 Atlas Augmentations
<div id="ch-9" markdown="9">
## Very Easy
[.ggg]Complete any three of the following League Mechanic encounters the specified number of times.
- [.ggg]Defeat Monsters with Essence x30
- [.ggg]Open Strongboxes x30
- [.ggg]Activate Shrines x30
- [.ggg]Defeat Harbingers x30
- [.ggg]Defeat Possessed Monsters x30
- [.ggg]Defeat Rogue Exiles x30
- [.ggg]Defeat Rare Beyond Monsters x30

Absolutely nothing special about these, you'll very likely complete them simply playing. No area level requirements at all make them especially easy.

You can use scarabs, the map device and Kirac missions to speed things up.
</div>

# 10 Mighty Mechanics
<div id="ch-10" markdown="10">
## Very Easy
[.ggg]Complete any five of the following League Mechanic encounters the specified number of times.
- [.ggg]Complete Breaches x30
- [.ggg]Complete Abysses x30
- [.ggg]Complete Expeditions x30
- [.ggg]Harvest Plots x100
- [.ggg]Complete Legion Encounters x30
- [.ggg]Open Smuggler's Caches x30
- [.ggg]Pass through Mirrors of Delirium x30
- [.ggg]Complete Ultimatum Waves x200
	- [.com]10 waves per actual completed ultimatum minimum means this is closer to 'Complete 20 Ultimatums' but you can also just do a couple of waves a lot of times
- [.ggg]Complete Blights x30
- [.ggg]Complete Rituals x100
- [.ggg]Complete Ore Deposit Encounters x60

As above but with a couple more mechanics thrown in.

You can use scarabs, the map device and Kirac missions to speed things up.

Ultimatum looks worse than it is, but you are not likely to finish 200 if you aren't choosing to do the mechanic actively.
</div>

# 11 Familiar Friends
<div id="ch-11" markdown="11">
## Easy
[.ggg]Complete any two of the following Master Mission encounters in Red or Purple Tier Maps the specified number of times.
- [.ggg]Niko Missions x30
- [.ggg]Einhar Missions x30
- [.ggg]Jun Missions x30
- [.ggg]Alva Missions x30

Red Maps but no tier requirement, spec into them on the Atlas and you can get 100% chance or simply use their Scarabs.

You can use scarabs, the map device and Kirac missions to speed things up.

All of these can be decent profit, Alva and Einhar being the most immediately profitable with Jun and Niko needing you to more deeply engage with their mechanics.
</div>

# 12 Combat Camaraderie
<div id="ch-12" markdown="12">
## Easy
[.ggg]Defeat 200 Rare or Unique Monsters while you have an Active Mercenary in Level 75 or higher areas.

Very straight forward, Level 75 is mid way through yellow maps so it's not too much of a requirement.
</div>

# 13 Vitriolic Vaal
<div id="ch-13" markdown="13">
## Easy
### Buyable
[.ggg]Defeat Atziri, Queen of the Vaal in the Alluring Abyss.

This is Uber Atziri, she uses the upgraded Sacrifice Set which can be bought on Faustus easily:
- Mortal Grief
- Mortal Ignorance
- Mortal Rage
- Mortal Hope

The biggest thing to know is that she has reflect and that while splitting into four clones one of them carries an even stronger reflect mirror which can easily lead to accidental deaths.

You can buy a carry easily enough if you aren't feeling up to it or you simply don't want to play around the reflect at all.

[.struck]It's very strange this is just here by itself in 2025, I'm not sure what GGG were thinking with this one.
</div>

# 14 Beloved Benches
<div id="ch-14" markdown="14">
## Very Easy
[.ggg]Unlock any 60 Crafting Bench Recipes from Map Areas.

There's a lot of crafting recipes now, you'll simply get this done by going through map completion for unlocking atlas points.

The crafting bench has an 'undiscovered' section that covers where any missing recipes are and the Atlas has some information on what spawns where.
</div>

# 15 Memorable Missions
<div id="ch-15" markdown="15">
## Normal
[.ggg]Complete any six of the following Kirac Atlas Missions.
- [.ggg]Defeat the Breachlord
	- [.com] Simply use an Otherworldly Scouting Report
- [.ggg]Open the Unique Strongbox
- [.ggg]Defeat the Elderslayer
	- [.com] Use Influenced Scouting Reports to get these at a higher rate
- [.ggg]Defeat the Elder's Guardian
	- [.com] Use Influenced Scouting Reports to get these at a higher rate
- [.ggg]Defeat the Shaper's Guardian
	- [.com] Use Influenced Scouting Reports to get these at a higher rate
- [.ggg]Complete the Einhar Mission
- [.ggg]Complete the Excursions
- [.ggg]Close all the Harbinger Portals
- [.ggg]Activate every Pantheon Shrine
- [.ggg]Slay the Imprisoned Exiles
- [.ggg]Defeat all Possessed Monsters
	- [.com] Can fail to complete
- [.ggg]Open all the Strongboxes

These are the new-old Kirac red tier missions, they're basically old ones with some new ones pulled over from the old memory sequences into atlas missions.

Get Kirac mission nodes and the nodes for dropping scouting reports to enable rerolling of his missions to look for these. Simply roll using any scouting report for the rarer ones, you should only need one of the non-standard ones total.

`Primal Cystcaller` also exists for Beastcrafting to get more missions without needing to spam map clears. If you want to save missions it's advised you ignore things like Vaal Temple even if you're tempted to go into them when you see them.

Buying these might also be viable if people are selling them, you'll likely need to engage with a discord server for this though.
</div>

# 16 Unreal Undertakings
<div id="ch-16" markdown="16">
## Normal
### Buyable
[.ggg]Complete any four of the following encounters where the area level is 81 or higher.
- [.ggg]Breachstones x5
	- [.com]All Breachstones will work outside of any weird Kirac mission outliers below normal level.
- [.ggg]Abyssal Depths x5
	- [.com]Do abyss with appropriate nodes selected to increase Depths chances
	- [.com]Despite the `Horned Scarab of Awakening` sounding good on paper, the `Imbued Abyss` map craft does not actually guarantee the spawn of an Abyssal Depth and is a waste of money over just doing more maps
- [.ggg]Logbooks with at least 10 Remnants active x5
	- [.com]You can simply buy these and then it's as simple as playing them normally
	- [.com]These are just the modifiers that activate as you blow things up
- [.ggg]Tier 4 Harvest Seeds x5
	- [.com]Crop Rotation can get you Tier 4s relatively even if it's not completely consistent
	- [.com]The `Harvest Scarab of Cornucopia` exists and allows you to force at least one Tier 4 monster to spawn
- [.ggg]Domains of Timeless Conflict with at least 25 rewards x3
	- [.com]Can be done in a four or five-way fairly easily as long as your build is decent at clearing, simply get the emblems
	- [.com]Buying in to a five-way rota will obviously complete this for you while also levelling you but is a lot more than simply buying the emblems if your character can handle it
- [.ggg]Blueprints with 4 revealed wings x5
	- [.com]Requires engaging with Heist as all the blueprint will require that you have levelled up your Rogues to be taken
	- [.com][Very simple to search for on the trade website](https://www.pathofexile.com/trade/search/Mercenaries/lVlbq2psV). Simply look for area level of 81 and set the heist section to include four revealed wings.
- [.ggg]Simulacrum Waves x60
	- [.com]Simply waves, doesn't need you to complete them
	- [.com]I would avoid attrition grinding if you can't do at least 10 waves and do something else instead as you will ultimately just be wasting money otherwise
- [.ggg]Trialmaster fights x3
	- [.com]You can force the Trialmaster with a `Ultimatum Scarab of Dueling`
	- [.com]Doing it without the scarab doesn't have particularly great rates but if you are farming catalysts for example you might not mind this
- [.ggg]Blighted or Blight Ravaged Maps x5
	- [.com]Can be cleared on any build even with zero DPS because of how the systems work
	- [.com]Clear, Sepia and Amber Oils to slow monsters and maximise your ability to build towers.
	- [.com]Ring anoint for Meteor Burning Ground and Chilling Towers Freeze Enemies.
	- [.com]Leave Seismic, Empowering and Ice towers at Level 3, use them in choke points and to stop things reaching the pump in general.
	- [.com]Minions should go to Scout Towers, Fire should go to Meteor Towers.
	- [.com]Build multiple damage types in each lane to cover immunities. Try to build towers around actual lane chokepoints.
	- [.com]Avoid immune to stun, chance to avoid elemental ailments and cannot be slowed below base speed as modifiers.
	- [.com]Blight ravaged is a lot harder but can still be managed with just those two ring anoints if you don't get a really, really bad layout
- [.ggg]All Rituals in Maps with at least one Blood-filled Vessel applied x30
	- [.com]Needs Ritual Vessels made from 100x Ritual Splinters
	- [.com]Use them on completed rituals to fill them up
	- [.com]Use filled ones as a map fragment when opening a portal to add the monsters to rituals
	- [.com]This is a fairly big undertaking compared to some of the others, you cannot fill vessels from rituals that used vessels making this a lot more than 30 in most cases
- [.ggg]Defeat Settler Bosses x3
	- [.com]`The Black Knight` appears in Starfall Crater found randomly in maps
		- [.com]Potentially needs Verisium Ore present within a map to be available but it could just be in any map with ore or any map in general like the wildwood, both seem less likely though
		- [.com]Confirmed it can happen alongside a `Lost Shipment` from the `Lost in Transit` node on the Atlas Tree
	- [.com]`Admiral Valerius` appears if your boats are taken by pirates
		- [.com]Sending out lots of shortest trip boats was a good bet for this in Settlers, might still be the same here
	- [.com]`Sasan` appears to ransom your Map Runners while they are active
		- [.com]Was exceptionally rare in Settlers, seems to still be true from personal experience

Level 81 means you will need to run tier 14 or higher maps.
</div>

# 17 Signature Specialisations 
<div id="ch-17" markdown="17">
## Normal
### RNG Heavy
[.ggg]Claim any five items from Mercenaries of the following Equipment Types while they have an "Infamous" or "of Infamy" Mercenary-Specific Modifier on them.
- [.ggg]Body Armour
- [.ggg]Weapon
- [.ggg]Quiver
- [.ggg]Helmet
- [.ggg]Amulet
- [.ggg]Ring
- [.ggg]Gloves
- [.ggg]Boots
- [.ggg]Belt

Somewhat awkward as there's no real way to search the mercenary items and they aren't highlighted by default. Simply hover over items while holding down alt and look for infamous of infamy.

[PoeDB](https://poedb.tw/us/Infamous_Modifiers#Infamous) naturally has a full list of the modifiers.

The modifiers are RNG and infamous spawns aren't super common, you'll want to have a build that can nuke any Mercenary ideally so you can stay at higher renown levels - ideally `Tremendously Renowned` - which increases the odds of infamous mercenaries spawning.

Renown is functionally a reputation system, not taking items, exiling or hiring mercenaries will cause renown to be lost while doing any interaction will cause it to be gained. As mentioned, you'll want to try and stay at `Tremendously Renowned` levels to maximise spawns.

You can find a very [basic AHK script here](https://craniumviolence.github.io/infamous-checker.ahk) which will cause a message box to pop up if there's a potential infamous suffix or prefix if you press `ctrl-alt-c` on each item in a Merc's inventory.

To use this get [AutoHotkey V2](https://www.autohotkey.com/) and install it and then simply double click the file. It will open an new icon in your toolbar with a green H which you can right click to close the script.

Please note that this will potentially interfere with price checking items with infamous modifiers using other tools simply due to those also checking the results of ctrl-alt-c.
</div>

# 18 Achieve Ascension
<div id="ch-18" markdown="18">
## Easy
[.ggg]Use the Ascendancy Device in each of the following Labyrinths.
- [.ggg]The Labyrinth
- [.ggg]The Cruel Labyrinth
- [.ggg]The Merciless Labyrinth
- [.ggg]The Eternal Labyrinth

Standard player progression, it's not the enriched version so it's simply a normal Offering to the Goddess labyrinth.

[PoeLab](https://www.poelab.com/) covers the layouts daily with useful notes.
</div>

# 19 Divined Destiny
<div id="ch-19" markdown="19">
## Easy
### Buyable
[.ggg]Complete any three of the following Divination Card tasks.
- [.ggg]Open Stacked Decks x50
	- [.com]Stacked Decks can commonly be found in Blighted Maps, Heist, Legion and by using `Diviner's Delirium Orbs` on maps
- [.ggg]Turn in sets of Divination Cards with a stack size of at least 10 x5
	- [.com][poe.ninja](https://poe.ninja/economy/mercenaries/divination-cards) allows you to sort by stack size by simply pressing the Stack Size button
	- [.com]Searching on Faustus for `card "0/[1-2][0-9]"` will give you results for every card type with a stack size of 10 or higher
	- [.com]Searching a Divination Card stash for `"/[1-2][0-9]"` will produce any 10 stack or higher cards you already own some of
- [.ggg]Scry a Map
	- [.com]The Nameless Seer can appear in T16 maps and gives you a random unique item and the option to put the current map's divination cards onto a single other map replacing the originals
	- [.com]You will find the Nameless Seer more often in maps with bad divination cards, don't run something with an apothecary expecting this to be simple
	- [.com]A chat notification 
- [.ggg]Turn in a set of Divination card that rewards a Two-implicit Unique item
	- [.com]Faustus makes this easier to accomplish, you can simply search for `Two-implicit` and it will return all options that give this and from those you can choose which unique you want to try and get
		- [.com]`The Enthusiasts` (3 stack)
		- [.com]`The Hive of Knowledge` (6 stack)
		- [.com]`Echoes of Love` (3 stack)

Normal divination related challenges, Stacked Decks are common in Blighted Maps but if you simply open them as you drop them you will get 50 without real issue.

</div>

# 20 Peddler's Produce II
<div id="ch-20" markdown="20">
## Very Easy
[.ggg]Complete vendor recipes to receive each of the following items. A vendor recipe is when you trade a specific combination of items to a vendor, not when you buy items from their purchase screen.
- [.ggg]Orb of Fusing
	- [.com]Vendor a `six-link item`
- [.ggg]Exalted Shard
	- [.com]Vendor a `full set of influence matching equipment` either IDed or otherwise
		- [.com]Influence should be of a single type, i.e. every item below with shaper influence
		- [.com]1x `Helmet`
		- [.com]1x `Body Armour`
		- [.com]1x `Gloves`
		- [.com]1x `Boots`
		- [.com]1x `Two Handed Weapon` or 2x `One Handed Weapon`
		- [.com]1x `Amulet`
		- [.com]1x `Belt`
		- [.com]2x `Rings`
- [.ggg]Unique Item
	- [.com]You can vendor three of any non-corrupted Unique Item in order to get a fresh copy back with new rolls
	- [.com]There is a [PoeWiki listing for all of these](https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/Vendor_recipe_system#Unique_items) which includes other options
- [.ggg]Item with Influence
	- [.com]Vendor an influenced amulet (not an onyx) and a gem of each colour (not white)
	- [.com]Vendor an influenced Iron Ring and any colour gem
	- [.com]Vendor any Normal Rarity Influenced Boots with an Augmentation Orb and a Quicksilver Flask
	- [.com]Vendor any Normal Rarity Influenced Weapon, Rustic Sash and a Whetstone
		- [.com]Only the weapon needs to be influenced, adds Increased Physical Damage to weapon types which can have the mod
	- [.com]Vendor any Normal Rarity Influenced Weapon, Chain Belt and a Whetstone
		- [.com]Only the weapon needs to be influenced, adds Increased Spell Damage to weapon types which can have the mod
	
More standard vendor recipes. You will likely want to set up an item filter for whatever influence type you intend to use for the Exalted Shard recipe if you want to self-find the items.
</div>

# 21 Striving Settlements
<div id="ch-21" markdown="21">
## Normal
[.ggg]Complete any four of the following Settlers of Kalguur tasks.
- [.ggg]Complete Port Quotas x10
	- [.com]This needed cheese last league, I'd be sceptical of it being any better in 3.26
	- [.com]It seems the worst option even if it's been made better simply by virtue of timers and chance of failure
	- [.com]The unique items `Ynda's Stand` and `Kaom's Command` or `Cadigan's Authority` and `Tawhoa's Felling` can result from fulfilling quotas to Kalguur and Karuti ports respectively, if you want to target these this might be a choice you get purely by coincidence.
- [.ggg]Disenchant Unique items x30
	- [.com]Very straight forward, throw uniques into disenchanting
- [.ggg]Claim rewards from Maps successfully completed by your Atlas Runners x50
	- [.com]Very straight forward, no tier requirement so you can throw white maps at level 4-5 mappers
- [.ggg]Have at least 150,000 gold in the Kingsmarch Treasury at once.
	- [.com]You can put in your gold and immediately take it out, very reasonable amount to target
- [.ggg]Have at least 5,000 Blue Zanthimum in your Kingsmarch Stockpile at once
	- [.com]Simply have your farmers farm the crop and you'll get it passively
- [.ggg]Have at least 2,500 Verisium Bars in your Kingsmarch Stockpile at once
	- [.com]Not too bad to get, you can bias towards Verisium with new atlas nodes and 2,500 is less than it sounds like
	- [.com]You can use a `Kalguuran Scarab of Refinement` to force the ore to become bars directly when you find it in maps if you want to skip smelting steps

Kingsmarch is unlocked after completing Act 10 in the Epilogue **by talking to Johan**. You will **lose all ores and resources gathered if you do not talk to him** so be sure to do that. Kingsmarch can be accessed quickly by typing `/kingsmarch`.

Just basic chores for the new Kingsmarch. The level 5 requirements makes hiring workers much easier than it was before and if you have Level 5 mappers they can even clear Tier 17 maps without much issue.
</div>

# 22 Equipped Elites
<div id="ch-22" markdown="22">
## Normal
[.ggg]Fill all Equipment slots of Mercenaries with the same type of Equipment with any five of the following Equipment Types.
- [.ggg]Unique
	- [.com]Easy
- [.ggg]Corrupted
	- [.com]Easy, you can even just corrupt one of the other sets of equipment you use for this
- [.ggg]Influenced
	- [.com]Pretty easy, you can pair this with the `Exalted Shard` recipe (Peddler's Produce II) to get two progression checkmarks down
- [.ggg]Mirrored
	- [.com]Dumb, strongboxes are the most likely place you'd find these along with using Reflecting Mists to get rings or amulets
- [.ggg]Fractured
	- [.com]Normal, fractured items drop fairly regularly and you'll likely get these with gameplay volume.
	- [.com]If you're running Betrayal you can use Vagan in Research to create fractured items but you don't get to choose what item type you get.
- [.ggg]Synthesized
	- [.com]Dumb, it's basically the above but with it being notably more awkward
	- [.com]Can be found in `Heist` or `Ritual` and potentially from other sources with specific equipment reward icons
	- [.com]Not recommended unless you have a reason to think you will get it naturally from the content you are doing
- [.ggg]Crafted
	- [.com]Very easy, can be combined with influenced or fractured
	- [.com]Literally just any item with a crafted modifier, scour, transmute and alt random items so they have a spare affix and then craft a random low cost thing onto them
- [.ggg]Split
	- [.com]Very dumb, can only be created using `Fenumal Plagued Arachnid` and beastcrafting or by using a `Fractured Fossil`
	- [.com]The actual beasts are terribly expensive overall but you can definitely finish five without doing this for far, far cheaper

You can take these items back after you give them to the mercenary, the items don't need to be specifically items you are fine with losing.
	- This will remove the original equipment completely on the mercenary, so don't do it to one you haven't geared out manually

In spite of it stating 'Mercenaries' you **only need to equip the items on a single mercenary**. A single set of any type of the items on a single mercenary will get you progress towards the challenge.

Buying junk items off trade is recommended but you can self-farm easily enough but I would recommend manually setting up a filter to actually remember what you need.
	- Bad Influenced items can be found by searching for **Has # Influences** under **Stat Filters**
	- Bad Fractured and Synthesis items can be found easily by setting the trade filters **Synthesised Item** or **Fractured Item** settings to **Yes** under **Miscellaneous**
	- Mirrored items can drop from strongboxes

The pieces double up and will count for every type of item they are (i.e. Corrupted, Influenced Gloves can be used for both of those checks fine).

**Single stat** mercenaries can use any piece of equipment that needs their single stat.

**Double stat** mercenaries can use pieces that exclusively need either of their stats (e.g. Str/Dex can use Str, Dex or Str and Dex hybrid pieces but not Str and Int hybrids)

**Triple stat** mercenaries can use pieces without needing to worry about the stats on those pieces at all. These are the obvious choice for this challenge as they eliminate the need to care about stats on armour pieces all together.

# 23 Remarkable Realms
<div id="ch-23" markdown="23">
## Easy
[.ggg]Complete 40 Unique Maps.

In a strange change, this is just raw numerical quantity of maps ran instead of doing all of them. 

You can use Kirac for these and there's a scouting report for unique maps as well as divination cards for them.

This is more Unique Maps than there actually are on the Atlas, so if you complete the full Atlas you will still need to do extras.

In terms of raw speed, Pillars of Arun or MaelstrÃ¶m of Chaos are probably good candidates that will likely be cheap.

Synthesis Memory maps all count towards this which makes them very good candidates to finish this up as they can be Maven witnessed to complete The Forgotten which is generally pretty good money (and can be ran magic or rare for progress towards Strenuous Summons). 

Other unique maps such as `Beachhead` also will as will `Untainted Paradise`, despite them not being on the atlas proper.

Simply use 20 of 27 different scarab types. You can use 3-5 per map making this very quick to knock out.

You can unlock additional map device slots for completing a `Tier 17 Map` and by completing a `Maven 10-Way Invitation` for a total of six slots allowing for 5 scarabs which enables this to be finished in four maps total.

# 25 Glorious Gemstones
<div id="ch-25" markdown="25">
## Normal
[.ggg]Complete any three of the following Gem tasks.
- [.ggg]Corrupt a gem to become either level 21 or 23% quality
	- [.com]Slam Vaal Orbs on Lv20 or 20% quality gems
	- [.com]Use the Lapidary Lens for better odds (Alva Temples)
- [.ggg]Use a Facetor's Lens to add experience to a Gem
	- You can get these from Trade, Lab, Harvest and Tora
- [.ggg]Have a socketed skill gem reach level 30 or 53% quality or higher
	-[.com]Quality is pretty easy, you can complete it with pretty cheap or common items 
		- [.com]`Crest of Desire` adds 5-8 levels and 30-50% quality to any inserted Skill Gem
		- [.com]`Replica Voideye` adds 30% quality and will reach 53% with a 23% quality gem
		- [.com]`Dialla's Malefaction` adds 30% quality to any gems in green sockets
		- [.com]Ashes of the Stars is +20-30% quality for all gems and +1 to level of all skill gems
	- Level 30 can need multiple items combined but it's possible you have the items lying around for it
		- [.com]`Pragmatism` adds +10 levels if only a single gem is socketed in, instantly fulfilling the requirement
		- [.com]`Cold Iron Point` adds +3 to level of physical gems, you can use two for +6
		- [.com]`Voideye` grants +5 levels
		- [.com]`Dialla's Malefaction` can grant +2 levels with red sockets
		- [.com]`Empower` is +1-3 levels or higher
		- [.com]`Bronn's Lithe` grants +5 levels to socketed movement gems
		- [.com]Corruption can be up to +3 levels for a chest piece for certain gem types
		- [.com]`Ashes of the Stars` is +1 to level of all skill gems
- [.ggg]Have a total of 300% quality on all socketed gems
	- [.com]This is across every gear piece, you can reach the 300% without links (unless you are utilising something like Empower or Enhance) or anything resembling a real set, simply get gear that would temporarily boost the quality up and you'll get the credit.
	- [.com]Fifteen 20% quality gems, not quite a full roster
	- [.com]You can combine with the above to take some of the pressure off 
	- [.com]Quality of Socketed Gems is found in the Armoury Map now and can count as 6-8% per gem
	- [.com]`Enhance` in a six link is +80% quality with Level 3 and +120% for Level 4
	- [.com]`Ashes of the Stars` is +20-30% quality for all gems which will instantly finish the challenge if you simply have at least gems socketed in general
	- [.com]Going for Facetor's Lens usage is probably easier if you aren't running fully quality gems for whatever reason
	
Normal gem related stuff, it can even be profit if you level things in your off hand to slam for Level 21 that wouldn't care about 20% quality.

### Buyable
[.ggg]Complete any four of the following past league content encounters.
- [.ggg]Defeat a Delirium Boss that is Possessed
	- [.com]Delirium Scarab of Neuroses will force spawn the bosses
	- [.com]Torment Scarabs can force extra tormented spirits
	- [.com]There is a ritual that spawns Tormented Spirits
	- [.com]Shore Map has a boss that spawns spirits at 50% and 25% HP respectively
- [.ggg]Defeat a Legion General while Delirious
    - [.com]**Unending Nightmare** will stop Fog ever dissipating
    - [.com]Any **Players are Delirious** map has permanent fog (1x Delirium Orb)
	- [.com]`Legion Scarab of Command` forces generals in a Legion (which can be forced with the normal `Legion Scarab`)
- [.ggg]Defeat an Essence Monster while affected by a Tempest
	- [.com]`Scarab of Radiant Storms` spawns tempests
	- [.com]The Corrupting Tempest special modifier spawns what it says
		- [.com]You will need to take `Shaping the Skies` on the atlas tree to get these Map Crafts, you only get 3% per completed map and there's multiple options so it's recommended you use the Scarab over this option
	- [.com]Simply either burst down an essence monster after you get a tempest on you or pre-damage it then get the tempest before finishing it (culling can help)
- [.ggg]Defeat a Beyond Boss while in a Breach
	- [.com]**Scarabs** can add additional Breaches.
		- [.com]You can use up to four in separate slots
	- [.com]The atlas tree adds a lot of options for breaches
	- [.com]`Beyond Scarab of the Invasion` and `Beyond Scarab of Haemophilia` paired with Beyond nodes on the atlas increase your chance of beyond bosses a lot
	- [.com]`Vaal Portal` might work for the condition but I've never had this confirmed for these challenges
- [.ggg]Defeat a Blight Boss while affected by a Shrine
	- [.com]Simply run maps with blight and shrines and kill a boss completely when you have tagged the shrine
	- [.com]`Blightspawn` on the atlas tree guarantees a lane will only have bosses
- [.ggg]Complete a Ore Deposit Encounter while Delirious
	- [.com]`Kalguuran Scarabs` force ore, you can also increase spawn rates with the atlas tree
    - [.com]Any **Players are Delirious** map has permanent fog (1x Delirium Orb)
	- [.com]Currently requires that you are running an actual **Players are Delirious** map and **doesn't trigger if you use a normal mirror in a map**

**Unending Nightmare** exists to stop Fog ever dissipating but that part of the challenge is either badly worded or bugged to require a delirious map rather than simply being delirious
	- The Legion General part works fine with a mirror so it is certainly one of the two
	
In terms of recommendations I'd definitely go with Essence, Legion General, Blight Boss and Ore Deposit as all of these mechanics can be very easily forced to interact. 

It's even entirely possible you could get all four of these on a single map in one go.

### Buyable
[.ggg]Complete one of the following Master Mission encounters the specified number of times.
- [.ggg]Defeat Delve Bosses in Level 75 or higher Areas x3
	- [.com]Delve is delve is delve, go down until you find bosses you'd probably want a specific build for it
	- [.com]You can buy taxis for this or pay to leech kills
		- [.com]A taxi is someone taking you to the boss and leaving, this stops their boss being consumed and allows you to kill it (you will *not* get drops from the boss on kill)
- [.ggg]Defeat Bestiary Bosses x20
	- [.com]You can buy beasts for this directly or pay to leech kills, the beasts are pretty cheap as they're not desirable bosses to run
		- [.com]Craicic Spider Crab
		- [.com]Farric Tiger Alpha
		- [.com]Fenumal Hybrid Arachnid
		- [.com]Saqawine Rhex
- [.ggg]Defeat the Syndicate Mastermind x4
	- [.com]Catarina is on a fragment now so you can ignore the entire betrayal mechanic and still
	- [.com]You can buy `Syndicate Medallion` for this directly or pay to leech kills
		- [.com]Can be expensive as the cost directly correlates to that of a Veiled Exalted orb
- [.ggg]Defeat the Vaal Omnitect in Level 75 or higher Areas x40
	- [.com]Farm temples using Alva nodes or buy `Chronicle of Atzoatl` at the required Level 75 or higher
	- [.com]Simply filter to having the temple apex open and you can ignore everything else
	- [.com]40 makes it unattractive as an option. You're stuck with whatever temple layouts you can buy and considering the boss has an invulnerability phase I would avoid these
	
Nothing remarkable. Syndicate Mastermind rework makes it very fast (the Leaders no longer spawn and you don't have to go into the corners any more) but the cost of it has rapidly increased so you'll be dumping in multiple divines if you don't luck out with a Veiled Exalted. 

A delve taxi would probably be the actual fastest if you can find one but if you have high DPS Catarina is very close.

# 29 Elated Exaltation

- [.ggg]Elder's Exalted Orb
- [.ggg]Shaper's Exalted Orb

You have two options on completing this, either dumping currency directly (or simply using it over the course of the league) or using the new Betryal Crafting Benches.

For the currency dump option, [poe.nina](https://poe.ninja/economy/mercenaries/currency?name=Exalted%20Orb) has active tracking for these and you can work out which is cheapest there or on the Currency Exchange.

For Betrayal you will need to look up a guide on how to best manage your members and aim for:
- Aisling in Fortification for `Veiled Exalted Orb` usage
- Elreon in Research for `Tainted Exalted Orb` usage
- Haku in Research for `Influence Exalted Orb` usages

You can also just casually run Jun using Scarabs or similar and gradually try to push people to the right spots without worrying too much.

# 30 Maniacal Magnitudes
<div id="ch-30" markdown="30">
## Normal
### Grind Heavy
[.ggg]Complete Maps with a total of 60,000% Item Quantity from modifiers and additional sources, such as Sacrifice Fragments. This does not include any quantity bonuses from your items or party.

You can get 15% quantity from the Atlas Tree, 8% from the Map Device, 5% from each part of a Sacrifice Fragment Set and 10% from each part of a Mortal Fragment Set.

Map Modifier Effect will also increase Item Quantity associated with modifiers.

Using up to five `Cartography Scarab of Risk` will add additional modifiers to your maps which will also add quantity and be affected by modifier effect.

You can expect a several hundred maps regardless of how you stack this. While more grind heavy than anything in GGG, this is still relatively mild as far as grind scales go.

If you want to blast it out you can run low tier 8-mod maps with all of the above combined. 

Completing a map is simply killing the boss so if you buy a map like `Mesa` in bulk you can also rapidly rush to the center to kill the boss as soon as possible.
</div>

# 31 Recollections Realised
<div id="ch-31" markdown="31">
## Normal
[.ggg]Complete each of the following Types of Map the specified number of times while they are at least Rare.

- [.ggg]Chambers of Impurity x4
	- [.com]This is the Incarnation of Fears' penultimate map
- [.ggg]Theatre of Lies x4
	- [.com]This is the Incarnation of Dread's penultimate map

You can target the memory chains you want using the new memory nodes at the top of the atlas. You'll be railroaded into one of each for just getting completions in general

All of the maps roll T17 modifiers regardless of tier, you can simply transmute - alteration - regal them to get minimum difficulty. You can also run a `Scarab of Bisection` to remove modifiers entirely paired with a `Scarab of Stability` to make it so you have extra portals for attempts.

At the time of writing mercenaries are pretty cracked, level 78 is any tier 11 or higher map. At the time since writing, they're still pretty cracked, but a bit less so.

You can run these white to avoid the mercenaries being completely insane but you will likely want a build that can off screen to reliably get them all right now.

There's not really anything specific you can do to make them more likely outside of hiring them and exiling the ones of types you have already done.

I don't think this is a rare enough occurrence to justify 'hard', but time will tell.

Pretty straight forward map grind challenge, expect to average around 100+ maps for the Eldritch Altars.

	- [.com]By default you can press the F key to consume them
	- [.com]You should get a couple hundred of these a map so simply getting the requirements for the other originator challenges will cover them
- [.ggg]Consume Memory Strands on Equipment x2000
	- [.com]Using the orbs above will consume memory strands as will modifying equipment with strands on them in general
	- [.com]You can just alt or chaos spam random pieces to rapidly consume strands, this can get you decent items to recombine if nothing else

The new originator influenced maps give items with Memory Strands on them, the new equipment types interact with these to add a 'buffed' crafting budget.

Because of the four requirement you will have to just dump currency, check [poe.ninja](https://poe.ninja/economy/mercenaries/currency) and the currency exchange to work out what are the best options at the time you are completing it.

# 35 Strenuous Summons
<div id="ch-35" markdown="35">
## Normal
### Buyable
[.ggg]Complete a total of 250 Modifiers on Invitations.

The various invitations can be rolled magic or rare with up to eight modifiers, five or six is probably more reasonable so expect to be doing around 50 of these.

A total of around 60 invites rolled on the lower end, this isn't particularly hard but is a lot of content due to the nature of how invitations work.

You can buy clears and you can buy invitations outright for non-maven encounters.

All explicitly named invitations count for this:
- Writhing Invitation
	- Cheap, potentially profitable
	- The Infinite Hunger
- Polaric Invitation
	- Cheap, unlikely to be profitable
	- The Black Star
- Incandescent Invitation
	- Moderate cost, low profit chance
	- The Searing Exarch
- Screaming Invitation
	- Moderate cost, low profit chance
	- The Eater of Worlds
- Maven's Invitation: The Atlas
	- Mildly tedious but can be combined with The Elderslayers using Destructive Play, likely to end up rather profitable as a paired grind especially if you also run Sirus
	- 10 Atlas Bosses
- Maven's Invitation: The Feared
	- Convoluted for a chained grind, prints `The Maven's Writ` and pairs well with running base Uber Elder as it counts as both The Shaper and The Elder for the rotation
	- Cortex
	- Chayula
	- Uber Atziri
		- Needs reflect immunity
	- The Shaper
	- The Elder
- Maven's Invitation: The Forgotten
	- Very good gold returns for time investment, decent chance of `Cortex` and a very low chance of jackpot rings
    - Rewritten Distant Memory
    - Augmented Distant Memory
    - Altered Distant Memory
    - Twisted Distant Memory
- Maven's Invitation: The Formed
	- Shaper sets mostly cover the cost of the run and Mavens generated will be pure profit
    - Lair of the Hydra Map
    - Maze of the Minotaur Map
    - Forge of the Phoenix Map
    - Pit of the Chimera Map
		- Can be rather annoying
- Maven's Invitation: The Hidden
	- Uul-Netol's Breachstone
    - Xoph's Breachstone
    - Tul's Breachstone
    - Esh's Breachstone
- Maven's Invitation: The Twisted
	- Selling the fragments will easily cover the cost of the maps, you can alternatively run them to fish for Watcher's Eyes to ID or sell
	- Obviously has the issue of watching the Elder murder original map bosses every time
	- The Purifier
	- The Constrictor
	- The Enslaver
	- The Eradicator
- Maven's Invitation: The Elderslayers
	- Can be combined with The Atlas using Destructive Play, likely to end up rather profitable as a paired grind especially if you also run Sirus
	- Al-Hezmin, the Hunter
	- Baran, the Crusader
	- Drox, the Warlord
	- Veritania, the Redeemer

As long as you have a build to do these you will likely always generate a decent profit finishing this up, otherwise you can simply run Writhing and Polarics for the fastest, cheapest completion.

# 36 Remembrance Repressed

### Buyable
[.ggg]Defeat any four of the following Endgame Memory Bosses in the specified ways.
- [.ggg]The Deceitful God without being affected by Divine Beam
	- [.com]This boss is based on Innocence
	- [.com]This is Innocence's stationary beam where he rotates to target you, if he's in a terrible position you can always log out and relog to abuse the grace period to avoid the beam
	- [.com]Incarnation of Dread thread
- [.ggg]The Neglected Flame without being affected by Corruption of the Awakener
	- [.com]This boss is based on Sirus
	- [.com]This is Sirus' beam debuff
	- [.com]Incarnation of Neglect thread
- [.ggg]The Cardinal of Fear without being affected by Charged Net
	- [.com]This boss is based on Cardinal Sanctus Vox
	- [.com]He throws a net with an obvious netting pattern, avoid this
	- [.com]Incarnation of Fear thread
- [.ggg]Incarnation of Dread without being hit by Encircling Fire Nova
	- [.com]In his second phase the boss will say `The Atlas is everything we see... and everything we do not.` and creates an area of effect attack that covers the arena outside of a small area around the boss, standin the circle to avoid being hit
- [.ggg]Incarnation of Fear without being affected by Anger's Intensity
	- [.com]The boss will say `"Overwhelming terror!` or `Consumed by fear!` and create up to three large, lingering balls that deal fire damage over time and inflict the Anger's Intensity debuff, avoid standing in these.
- [.ggg]Incarnation of Neglect without being hit by Falling Comets
	- [.com]They are exactly what they sound like, stay moving while you fight him and you should be fine

These are all new bosses, the first three are very easy to burst down since you can run them as white with minimal issue.

As is often the case, DPS is king here as the less time they have to do anything the less chance there is of making a mistake and failing a conditional.

You are guaranteed one of these bosses from memory threads and there are new nodes at the top of the atlas tree to influence which bosses you get.

# 37 Pinnacles Paired

	- [.com]`Fragment of the Hydra`
	- [.com]`Fragment of the Chimera`
	- [.com]`Fragment of the Phoenix`
	- [.com]`Fragment of the Minotaur`

	- [.com]`Fragment of Knowledge`
	- [.com]`Fragment of Shape`

	- [.com]`The Maven's Writ`
- [.ggg]The Eater of Worlds
	- [.com]`Screaming Invitation`	
- [.ggg]The Searing Exarch
	- [.com]`Incandescent Invitation`
- [.ggg]High Templar Venarius in Cortex
	- [.com]`Cortex Synthesised Map`

These are a bit awkward but you can simply **leave your mercenary in reserve** get the boss nearly dead and then log out and **invite the mercenary back** in order to get them to join you at the end of the fight.

Mercenaries are however incredibly tanky and a level 83 one will likely happily tank the vast majority of bosses as long as you have the DPS to make sure they don't take overly long. They play Sirus like they are using cheat codes and go wandering in storms and come out just fine!

You can obviously also pay for kills and simply have your mercenary active when you enter the instance for credit.

	- [.com]Uses `Blazing Fragment` and is moderately priced
- [.ggg]The Eater of Worlds in Absence of Symmetry and Harmony
	- [.com]Uses `Devouring Fragment` and is expensive
- [.ggg]High Templar Venarius in Cortex
	- [.com]Uses `Synthesising Fragment` and is relatively cheap
- [.ggg]The Shaper in The Shaper's Realm
	- [.com]Uses `Cosmic Fragment` and is not too expensive

This is four of the seven uber boss variants, if you have a boss killer this should be fine, otherwise you can buy the clears.

Shaper and Cortex are the most reasonable to self-complete with the others varying wildly by your build.

All of the fights have lingering damage over time that lasts the entire fight which makes high DPS crucial if you want to have leeway in your execution. The longer the fight the worse the arena and the more likely you are to fail.

# 40 Grinding Gear Goals
<div id="ch-40" markdown="40">
## Normal
### Grind Heavy
[.ggg]Complete any four of these encounters the specified number of times.
- [.ggg]Reach Level 100	
	- [.com]Buying Five Way runs
	- [.com]Pure Chayula and other higher end Breachstones
	- [.com]Coward's Trial
	- [.com]T15 Beachheads
	- [.com]`Omen of Amelioration` stops you losing all your XP on dying, but only once per area
		- [.com]Something to keep in mind is that this is triggered *regardless of if you can actually lose XP in an area* do not take one into an invitation or uber boss, you will still lose your Omen despite no XP loss being possible
- [.ggg]Use the Divine Font in the Endgame Labyrinth x75
	- [.com]You can get multiple of these a run from darkshrines and as it's the Endgame Labyrinth you always get a baseline two uses
	- [.com]`Gift to the Goddess` allows you to use the divine font multiple times in a single run
		- [.com](I'm assuming these count towards the total in spite of technically being a tier above the Endgame Labyrinth)
	- [.com]Expect in the region of 30 normal labs if you get darkshrines
- [.ggg]Complete Shaper, Elder, Conqueror or Memory Guardian Maps with at least 80% Item Quantity x50
	- [.com]You can use the Atlas's Item Quantity and Modifier effect nodes to make it easier and basically allow alch and go with the extra +% Item Quantity from there and the Map Device itself.
	- [.com]You can get 15% quantity from the Atlas Tree, 8% from the Map Device, 5% from each part of a Sacrifice Fragment Set and 10% from each part of a Mortal Fragment Set.
- [.ggg]Complete collective tiers of Tier 14 or Higher Maps x1000
	- [.com]Incredibly trivial, not even 72 maps even if you exclusively only map in T14s for some reason
- [.ggg]Tier 14 or higher Maps completed with Mercenaries x100
	- [.com]Incredibly trivial, simply map with mercenaries
- [.ggg]Defeat Pinnacle bosses while the area is level 85 x30
	- [.com]This is thirty uber bosses, if you are going to do that you already know without needing this site

Shockingly lenient in a lot of ways for a GGG, this might be one of the only times I'd actually recommend it as a reasonable choice for 36.

Skipping Level 100 and 30x Uber Bosses are very obvious choices for most people.

# Easing Long Term Grind
This section is just a list of challenges you can work towards somewhat passively to avoid finding yourself with no progress on bigger time investment challenges.

Most of the longer term grinds this time around are simply going to boil down to 'do normal mapping' but, there's a few that you might not naturally engage with which you can simply add as you go:

#### Various Mercenary Challenges
- Combat Camaraderie, Assisted Atlas, Pinnacles Paired and Grinding Gear Goals all require you to have active mercenaries on various pieces of content
- Simply get a level 83-84 Mercenary that you don't mind having present, make sure they aren't paper and they will likely tank everything while getting you credit towards these.

#### Endgame Enigmas
- Get your four watchstones as soon as reasonably possible, you get a drastically smaller amount of T17 drops without them
	- You get one from each of Searing Exarch, Eater of Worlds, Uber Elder and Maven
	- 0.4%, 1.6%, 3.6% and 6.4% chance with 1 through 4 stones respectively
- Avoid selling your Tier 17s so you actually have a stock of them, these aren't terribly expensive this league but buying thirty outright would still cost a lot.

#### Grinding Gear Goals
- Mercenaries ones are free and you'll likely finish them before most challenges if you are mapping
- Run Guardian maps whenever you find them ensuring they're rare and run them on Kirac if he has them at 80% quantity and you have no other plans on using them
- Do labs whenever you see someone mention it being a nice layout or check the layout each day on [PoeLab](https://www.poelab.com/) to see if it's easy yourself
	- You can simply buy the `Offering to the Goddess` items off kirac now which is a lot smoother
- Level 100 is something you probably already know if you will get or not but you can get the `Omen of Amelioration` to avoid losing XP while working towards it
- The Uber Bosses is fairly straight forward but if you simply buy a set of fragments for one you can kill occasionally you'll get this done passively

#### Maniacal Magnitudes
- The biggest actual raw grind, the best way to progress on this is just always mapping with at least some amount of quantity
- Mesa or Bog are very 
- If your build can handle the random mods you can always throw `Cartography Scarab of Risk` into your map device to get extra progression towards this
- An atlas tree around quantity and map modifier effect is the best way to push this over time
- Any map tier is fine so if you can find a strategy you like that only needs white or yellow maps you can simply run those

#### Strenuous Summons
- There are two main ways to generate extra invitations:
	- Incorporate a full Maven Rotation into whatever strategy you are running, as long as it isn't destructive play 
	- Avoid selling the invitations you get for using Eater and Exarch on the map device and simply roll them, this will quickly rack up its count if you simply run either of them and use the node that doubles progress
- You can run all invitations rare when you drop them, if you're very worried you can transmute-regal them to get lower mod counts to make them easier

#### Recollections Realised
- Actually do your memory chains when you get them, don't just leave them rotting on Eagon
- Get the atlas nodes at the top of the tree for more chances of memory chains and maps if your tree allows it
- Get the atlas nodes for the memory chains you've already finished four of in order to make it less likely that you repeat them
	- `Courtyard of Wasting` is the `Incarnation of Neglect`'s penultimate encounter
	- `Chambers of Impurity` is the `Incarnation of Fear`'s 's penultimate encounter
	- `Theatre of Lies` is the `Incarnation of Dread`'s penultimate encounter

#### Revered Return
- As above, actually do your memory chains when you get them, don't just leave them rotting on Eagon
- Mash the keys for your petal abilities constantly even if outside of combat or packs to use them up if you aren't naturally using them
- Pick up all Memory Strand items and simply roll them with magic currency (or chaos if you're feeling adventurous)
- Do the echo bosses when you get them at the end of chains over selling them as they can drop the relatively expensive currency sink items

#### Infamous Instigators
- Either always kill mercenaries to keep your renown up or simply never interact with them at all to avoid it going down and only bother with infamous ones
	- Their pocket lint can be divine orbs or higher so if you can nuke them I'd always bother doing it, even if you mostly end up getting a chromatic, a transmutation and an alf pog
- You can try and keep on top of exiling bad combinations based on your progress but it can get tedious

#### Familiar Friends
- Simply throw the various master mission scarabs into your map device to force them if you have the space to justify it while doing other content
	- Jun missions are forced with  `Betrayal Scarab`
	- Niko missions are forced with  `Sulphite Scarab`
	- Alva missions are forced with `Incursion Scarab`
	- Einhar missions are forced with `Bestiary Scarab`

#### Special Item Types
- Set up an item filter for whatever choice of items
	- Filterblade is simply actually bad for setting this up quickly, I would recommend downloading a local filter file and changing it in there (open the .filter file and simply throw a rule at the top)
	- If this isn't an option (streaming or console gamers) you can go into the [Path of Exile Account Page](https://www.pathofexile.com/my-account) and press the `Item Filters` button at the bottom right which will let you stick rules at the top of a filter
- A very basic example of things you could use for a manual filter block is below. Keep in mind that with this first it will be matched as the first result and override any other styles that might happen to match (fractured with 30% quality, for example)
```
[.true]Show # Fractured
	FracturedItem True
    SetFontSize 38
    SetBorderColor 100 190 190 255
    SetBackgroundColor 50 190 190 200
    MinimapIcon 0 Blue Diamond
    PlayEffect Blue
	Rarity <= Rare

Show # Mirrored
	Mirrored True
    SetFontSize 38
    SetBorderColor 100 190 190 255
    SetBackgroundColor 50 190 190 200
    MinimapIcon 0 Blue Diamond
    PlayEffect Blue
	Rarity <= Rare

Show # Shaper Items
	HasInfluence Shaper

    SetBorderColor 100 190 190 255
    SetBackgroundColor 50 190 190 200
    MinimapIcon 0 Blue Diamond
    PlayEffect Blue
	Rarity <= Rare
```
- You can replace Shaper with any of Shaper, Elder, Crusader, Hunter, Redeemer, Warlord depending on what you want to get.
- An uncommonly seen option is also just making a completely new filter line and then making it load your actual filter afterwards

# Challenges to Skip
You get the full armour set at **36/40** this time around, so you get to skip up to four different challenges.

What you skip (if anything) will come down to what characters you want to build and how willing you are to buy challenge completion over clearing them yourself.

As a baseline, I'd say serious considerations should be made for the following (in vague order of how much I'd say the skip is worth):

- Grinding Gear Goals
	- Even though it's very mild it's still an obvious grind heavy challenge that can be avoided
- Powerful Pursuits
	- Uber Bossing isn't something everyone can do nor is it something every character builds for, buying them shouldn't break the bank but is's completely viable to skip them too
- Revered Return
	- It's just a money sink, there's no real benefit to engaging with it in any way, at current prices it's a few divines but this might change over the league
- Endgame Enigmas
	- If you don't have a build that is made for T17s or you don't enjoy them this is an obvious skip
	- This is so low because you can neuter T17s pretty heavily (and can often land rolls that won't affect your character in general). As long as you can clear the maps, you can make back the cost of entry back from fragment drops or even profit from them alone.
- Strenuous Summons
	- Depending on character this might be a slog and also a currency sink for very little returns
- Maniacal Magnitudes
	- Depending on how you play, you might be done before ever finishing this one off
	
Generally speaking the challenges are fairly easy this time around, the skips are truly dealer's choice depending on what you want to do in the game.
