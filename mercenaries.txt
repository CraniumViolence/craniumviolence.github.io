# Mercenaries of Trarthus Challenges
Please get in touch through [Github](https://github.com/CraniumViolence/craniumviolence.github.io) if any information here is incorrect, absent or you simply have better strategies or information! I don't currently operate a reddit account so this is the only way to get in touch for now.

This guide makes the assumption that you have a baseline understanding of Path of Exile and does not include complex instructions for a lot of aspects such as explaining what a mechanic is (with the obvious exception of current league or new mechanics getting more attention). 

Nothing on this page is SSF oriented but as previously, if people want things flagged as bad for SSF for whatever reason just shout at me on the link above.

This is genuinely maybe the easiest 40 they've ever had. It's made up for by the fact if you are in Europe, Russia, Asia or use the Washington server the game is borderline unplayable and will regular destroy instances, what a treat!

<div id="ch-12" markdown="12">
[.ggg]Defeat 200 Rare or Unique Monsters while you have an Active Mercenary in Level 75 or higher areas.

Very straight forward, Level 75 is mid way through yellow maps so it's not too much of a requirement.
</div>

# 13 Vitriolic Vaal
<div id="ch-13" markdown="13">
[.ggg]Defeat Atziri, Queen of the Vaal in the Alluring Abyss.

This is Uber Atziri. 

The biggest thing to know is that she has reflect and that while splitting into four clones one of them carries an even stronger reflect mirror which can easily lead to accidental deaths.

You can buy a carry easily enough if you aren't feeling up to it.
</div>

# 14 Beloved Benches
<div id="ch-14" markdown="14">
[.ggg]Unlock any 60 Crafting Bench Recipes from Map Areas.

Primal Cystcaller also exists for Beastcrafting to get more missions.
</div>

# 16 Unreal Undertakings

- [.ggg]Blighted or Blight Ravaged Maps x5

	- [.com]Clear, Sepia and Amber Oils to slow monsters and maximise your ability to build towers.

	- [.com]Leave Seismic, Empowering and Ice towers at Level 3, use them in choke points and to stop things reaching the pump in general.
	- [.com]Minions should go to Scout Towers, Fire should go to Meteor Towers.
	- [.com]Build multiple damage types in each lane to cover immunities. Try to build towers around actual lane chokepoints.
	- [.com]Avoid immune to stun, chance to avoid elemental ailments and cannot be slowed below base speed as modifiers.

	- [.com]Needs Ritual Vessels made from 100x Ritual Splinters
	- [.com]Use them on completed rituals to fill them up

	- [.com]Set up your mappers and sailors and leave them running as much as possible to get bosses to spawn
	- [.com]Set up your atlas to add ore to maps so you have better chances of starfall crater

- [.ggg]Weapon
- [.ggg]Quiver

- [.ggg]Amulet
- [.ggg]Ring

Awkward as there's no real way to search the mercenary items and they aren't highlighted. Simply hover over items while holding down alt.

[PoeDB](https://poedb.tw/us/Infamous_Modifiers#Infamous) naturally has a full list of the modifiers.
</div>

		- ![][div-card] Duality (2 stack)

Normal divination related challenges, stack decks are very common in Blighted Maps.
</div>

# 20 Peddler's Produce II

	- [.com]Simply have your farmers farm the crop and you'll get it passively
- [.ggg]Have at least 2,500 Verisium Bars in your Kingsmarch Stockpile at once

Just basic chores for the new Kingsmarch.

You can take these items back after you give them to the mercenary so you don't need it to be any specifically disposable goods. 

Don't dismiss them without taking the items off, though.
</div>

# 23 Remarkable Realms
<div id="ch-23" markdown="23">
[.ggg]Complete 40 Unique Maps.

In a strange change, this is just raw quantity. You can use Kirac for these and there's a scouting report for unique maps as well as divination cards for them.
</div>

# 27 Assisted Atlas
<div id="ch-27" markdown="27">
[.ggg]Complete a collective 750 Tiers of Maps while you have an Active Mercenary.

It's grinding out maps, there's no limit on the tier of maps so all should count towards it fine.
It's 47 raw T16 maps but unless you never hire mercenaries in maps you'll not actually need that many of them.
</div>

# 28 Formidable Fights

</div>

- [.ggg]Swiftblade [.com](Str/Dex)
- [.ggg]Combatant [.com](Str/Dex)

At the time of writing mercenaries are pretty cracked, level 78 is any tier 11 or higher map.
You can run these white to avoid the mercenaries being completely insane but you will likely want a build that can off screen to reliably get them all right now.
There's not really anything specific you can do to make them more likely outside of hiring them and exiling the ones of types you have already done.

	- [.com]These are at the end of each step of a memory chain, you'll get three per run meaning 11 full memory chains are needed.

Pretty straight forward map grind challenge, expect to average around 100+ maps for the Eldritch Altars.

# 34 Revered Return
<div id="ch-34" markdown="34">
[.ggg]Complete any four of the following Originator Influence challenges.
- [.ggg]Use Orbs of Rememberance x5
	- [.com]Moderately priced
	- [.com]GGG can't spell Remembrance
- [.ggg]Use Orbs of Unravelling x5
	- [.com]Highest priced
- [.ggg]Use Orbs of Intention x10
	- [.com]Very cheap
- [.ggg]Consume Petals x25000
	- [.com]You gain petals while inside the new originator influenced maps
	- [.com]By default you can press the F key to consume them
	- [.com]You should get a couple hundred of these a map so simply getting the requirements for the other originator challenges will cover them
- [.ggg]Consume Memory Strands on Equipment x2000
	- [.com]Using the orbs above will consume memory strands as will modifying equipment with strands on them in general
	- [.com]You can just alt spam random piecse to rapidly consume them

The new originator influenced maps give items with Memory Strands on them, the new equipment types interact with these to add a 'buffed' crafting budget.

Because of the four requirement you will have to just dump currency, check [poe.ninja](https://poe.ninja/economy/mercenaries/currency) and the currency exchange to work out what are the best options at the time you are completing it.

# 35 Strenuous Summons
<div id="ch-35" markdown="35">
[.ggg]Complete a total of 250 Modifiers on Invitations.

The various invitations can be rolled magic or rare with up to eight modifiers, five or six is probably more reasonable so expect to be doing around 50 of these.

A total of around 60 invites rolled on the lower end, this isn't particularly hard but is a lot of content due to the nature of how invitations work.

You can buy clears and you can buy invitations outright for non-maven encounters.

All explicitly named invitations count for this:
- Writhing Invitation
	- Cheap, likely profitable
	- The Infinite Hunger
- Polaric Invitation
	- Cheap
	- The Black Star
- Incandescent Invitation
	- Moderate cost, low profit chance
	- The Searing Exarch
- Screaming Invitation
	- Moderate cost, low profit chance
	- The Eater of Worlds
- Maven's Invitation: The Atlas
	- Mildly tedious but can be combined with The Elderslayers using Destructive Play, likely to end up rather profitable as a paired grind especially if you also run Sirus
	- 10 Atlas Bosses
- Maven's Invitation: The Feared
	- Convoluted for a chained grind, prints maven invites and pairs well with running base Uber Elder
	- Cortex
	- Chayula
	- Uber Atziri
		- Needs reflect immunity
	- The Shaper
	- The Elder
- Maven's Invitation: The Forgotten
	- Very good gold returns for time investment, decent chance of Cortex and a very low chance of jackpot rings
    - Rewritten Distant Memory
    - Augmented Distant Memory
    - Altered Distant Memory
    - Twisted Distant Memory
- Maven's Invitation: The Formed
	- Shaper sets mostly cover the cost of the run and Mavens generated will be pure profit
    - Lair of the Hydra Map
    - Maze of the Minotaur Map
    - Forge of the Phoenix Map
    - Pit of the Chimera Map
		- Can be rather annoying
- Maven's Invitation: The Hidden
	- Uul-Netol's Breachstone
    - Xoph's Breachstone
    - Tul's Breachstone
    - Esh's Breachstone
- Maven's Invitation: The Twisted
	- Selling the fragments will easily cover the cost of the maps, you can alternatively run them to fish for Watcher's Eyes to ID or sell
	- Obviously has the issue of watching the Elder murder original map bosses every time
	- The Purifier
	- The Constrictor
	- The Enslaver
	- The Eradicator
- Maven's Invitation: The Elderslayers
	- Can be combined with The Atlas using Destructive Play, likely to end up rather profitable as a paired grind especially if you also run Sirus
	- Al-Hezmin, the Hunter
	- Baran, the Crusader
	- Drox, the Warlord
	- Veritania, the Redeemer

As long as you have a build to do these you will likely always generate a decent profit finishing this up, otherwise you can simply run Writhing and Polarics for the fastest, cheapest completion.

# 36 Remembrance Repressed
<div id="ch-36" markdown="36">
[.ggg]Defeat any four of the following Endgame Memory Bosses in the specified ways.
- [.ggg]The Deceitful God without being affected by Divine Beam
	- [.com]This boss is based on Innocence
	- [.com]This is Innocence's stationary beam where he rotates to target you
	- [.com]Incarnation of Dread thread
- [.ggg]The Neglected Flame without being affected by Corruption of the Awakener
	- [.com]This boss is based on Sirus
	- [.com]This is Sirus' beam debuff
	- [.com]Incarnation of Neglect thread
- [.ggg]The Cardinal of Fear without being affected by Charged Net
	- [.com]This boss is based on Cardinal Sanctus Vox
	- [.com]He throws a net with an obvious netting pattern, avoid this
	- [.com]Incarnation of Fear thread
- [.ggg]Incarnation of Dread without being hit by Encircling Fire Nova
	- [.com]I haven't fought this yet due to EU servers!
- [.ggg]Incarnation of Fear without being affected by Anger's Intensity
	- [.com]I haven't fought this yet due to EU servers!
- [.ggg]Incarnation of Neglect without being hit by Falling Comets
	- [.com]They are exactly what they sound like, stay moving while you fight him and you should be fine
	
These are all new bosses, the first three are very easy to burst down since you can run them as white with minimal issue.
You are guaranteed one of these bosses from memory threads and there are new nodes at the top of the atlas tree to influence which bosses you get.
</div>

# 37 Pinnacles Paired
<div id="ch-37" markdown="37">
[.ggg]Defeat the following Pinnacle Boss Encounters while you have an Active Mercenary.
- [.ggg]The Shaper
	- [.com]Normal shaper
	- [.com]`Fragment of the Hydra`
	- [.com]`Fragment of the Chimera`
	- [.com]`Fragment of the Phoenix`
	- [.com]`Fragment of the Minotaur`
- [.ggg]The Elder
	- [.com]`Fragment of Purification`
	- [.com]`Fragment of Constriction`
	- [.com]`Fragment of Enslavement`
	- [.com]`Fragment of Eradication`
- [.ggg]Sirus, Awakener of Worlds
	- [.com]`Veritania's Crest`
	- [.com]`Drox's Crest`
	- [.com]`Baran's Crest`
	- [.com]`Al-Hezmin's Crest`
- [.ggg]The Maven
	- [.com]`The Maven's Writ`
- [.ggg]The Eater of Worlds
	- [.com]`Screaming Invitation`	
- [.ggg]The Searing Exarch
	- [.com]`Incandescent Invitation`
- [.ggg]High Templar Venarius in Cortex
	- [.com]`Cortex`

These are a bit awkward but you can simply **leave your mercenary in reserve** get the boss nearly dead and then log out and **invite the mercenary back** in order to get them to join you at the end of the fight.
You can obviously also pay for kills and simply have your mercenary active when you enter the instance for credit.
</div>

# 38 Endgame Enigmas
<div id="ch-38" markdown="38">
[.ggg]Complete 30 Tier 17 Maps.
</div>

# 39 Powerful Pursuits
<div id="ch-39" markdown="39">
[.ggg]Defeat any four of the following Pinnacle Boss Encounters while the area is level 85.
- [.ggg]Sirus, Awakener of Worlds in Eye of the Storm
	- [.com]Uses `Awakening Fragment` and is moderately priced
- [.ggg]The Elder in The Shaper's Realm
	- [.com]Uses `Decaying Fragment` and is moderately priced
- [.ggg]The Maven in Absence of Mercy and Empathy
	- [.com]Uses `Reality Fragment` and is very expensive
- [.ggg]The Searing Exarch in Absence of Patience and Wisdom
	- [.com]Uses `Blazing Fragment` and is moderately priced
- [.ggg]The Eater of Worlds in Absence of Symmetry and Harmony
	- [.com]Uses `Devouring Fragment` and is expensive
- [.ggg]High Templar Venarius in Cortex
	- [.com]Uses `Synthesising Fragment` and is relatively cheap
- [.ggg]The Shaper in The Shaper's Realm
	- [.com]Uses `Cosmic Fragment` and is not too expensive

This is four of the seven uber boss variants, if you have a boss killer this should be fine, otherwise you can buy the clears.

All of the fights have lingering damage over time that lasts the entire fight which makes high DPS crucial if you want to have leeway in your execution. The longer the fight the worse the arena and the more likely you are to fail.
</div>

# 40 Grinding Gear Goals
<div id="ch-40" markdown="40">
[.ggg]Complete any four of these encounters the specified number of times.
- [.ggg]Reach Level 100	
	- [.com]Buying Five Way runs
	- [.com]Pure Chayula and other higher end Breachstones
	- [.com]Coward's Trial
	- [.com]T15 Beachheads
	- [.com]`Orb of Amelioration` stops you losing all your XP on dying, but only once per area
- [.ggg]Use the Divine Font in the Endgame Labyrinth x75
	- [.com]You can get multiple of these a run from darkshrines
	- [.com]`Gift to the Goddess` allows you to use the divine font multiple times
	- [.com]Expect in the region of 60 normal labs if you get dark shrines
- [.ggg]Complete Shaper, Elder, Conqueror or Memory Guardian Maps with at least 80% Item Quantity x50
	- [.com]You can use the Atlas's Item Quantity and Modifier effect nodes to make it easier and basically allow alch and go with the extra +% Item Quantity from there and the Map Device itself.
	- [.com]You can get 30% quantity from the Atlas Tree, 8% from the Map Device, 5% from each part of a Sacrifice Fragment Set and 10% from each part of a Mortal Fragment Set.
- [.ggg]Complete collective tiers of Tier 14 or Higher Maps x1000
	- [.com]Incredibly trivial, not even 72 maps even if you exclusively only map in T14s for some reason
- [.ggg]Tier 14 or higher Maps completed with Mercenaries x100
	- [.com]Incredibly trivial, simply map with mercenaries
- [.ggg]Defeat Pinnacle bosses while the area is level 85 x30
	- [.com]This is thirty uber bosses, if you are going to do that you already know without needing this site

Shockingly lenient in a lot of ways for a GGG, this might be one of the only times I'd actually recommend it as a reasonable choice for 36.

# Challenges to Skip
What you skip (if anything) will come down to what characters you want to build and how willing you are to buy challenge completion over clearing them yourself.
As a baseline serious considerations should be made for:
	- Endgame Enigmas

# Unlocks
This league is a return to a full armour set. 
- At 12 challenge completion you can unlock the Watcher's Wrath Boots.
- At 20 challenge completion you can unlock the Watcher's Wrath Gloves.
